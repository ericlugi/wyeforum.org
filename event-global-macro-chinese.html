          <h2>Event overview</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">
            The opening session of the World Young Economists'Forum featured a wide-ranging keynote by Professor Li Jinliang, Professor at School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, offering a structured and data-driven overview of China’s economic transformation in both historical and global context.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Beginning with long-term growth patterns, Professor Li examined China’s trajectory since reform and opening-up, situating four decades of rapid GDP expansion within broader dynamics of industrialization, urbanization, and integration into the world economy. He emphasized the interaction between supply-side expansion through industrial development and demand growth driven by large-scale rural-to-urban migration, presenting this dual mechanism as a central engine of China’s modernization
          </p>
		  <p class="text-muted">
			The lecture moved beyond headline growth figures to address deeper structural foundations. Professor Li traced China’s post-1978 performance to institutional and social investments made earlier, including mass education, cooperative organization, and the formation of a nationally integrated industrial base. Rather than portraying growth as an unexplained anomaly, he framed China’s rise as a return to global productivity norms after prolonged historical constraints, grounded in long-term preparation and policy continuity
		  </p>
		  <p class="text-muted">
			A substantial portion of the session was dedicated to present-day challenges and future direction. Topics included productivity and energy efficiency, demographic transition, financial stability, technological self-reliance, and China’s shift from high-speed growth toward innovation-driven, consumption-oriented, and service-led development. Professor Li also addressed environmental constraints and carbon neutrality, situating China’s policy choices within an increasingly complex global economic environment marked by fragmentation and trade frictions
		  </p>
		  <p class="text-muted">
			The keynote concluded with a forward-looking discussion of reform, openness, and resilience, emphasizing innovation and institutional adaptability as key determinants of sustained development. An extended Q&A allowed participants to engage with issues ranging from macroeconomic structure to long-term societal transformation, setting an ambitious intellectual tone for the Forum’s future sessions.
